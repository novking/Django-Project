(Discounts are applied to purchases of 10 or more sessions.) Designed by our senior trainer, who holds an active certification with the National Council on Strength and Fitness (NCSF), your program is tailored to help you meet your specific goals and to keep you motivated while you embark on your new fitness program.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Light is essential to all life on earth. There are various physiological and psychological reasons why exposure to light is desirable and necessary. There's a growing body of scientific evidence showing people actually require light exposure to function effectively. Light exposure causes the brain to suppress the release of the hormone melatonin that acts as a depressant in the body and exposure to light produces various health benefits, such as the production of the very necessary Vitamin D3 in the prevention of bone diseases (such as osteoporosis) and in the improvement of symptoms of psoriasis.</p>
